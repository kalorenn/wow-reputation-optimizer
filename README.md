# A quick calculator for reputation optimizers for all Horde capitals in WOTLK 3.3.5

This program calculates the lowest minimum donations needed to simultaneously raise your reputation with
the respective horde capitals. It will also work for all Alliance capitals respectively. Note that there
are actually five capitals, however the program ignores your race capital as you already have max
reputation anyways.

Input your current rep with each city and the program will calculate how much stacks of Runecloth you will
need to donate to each city Quartermaster to raise your rep most effectively.

This program is made for the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, more specifically for the Warmane private server.

**TODO:** Accomodate for the humans' racial attribute that increases gained rep - this will result in a different calculation.
